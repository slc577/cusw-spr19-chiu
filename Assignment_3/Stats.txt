What case study area did you pick and why?

I studied the BlueBike trip data in Boston, mostly because I couldn't get the U.S. Census data to export through QGIS. Other than that, I like how BlueBike makes their data extra clean. I looked at rider data for only a handful of stations to keep the visualizations less cluttered. I also extracted trips during morning peak hours, because I felt most of those riders would be commuting to work.

What metrics did you pick and why?

I looked at user quantity, age, and gender, because those are the only demographics that BlueBike records.

What statistical test did you use and why?

I used a Chi-Square test, because I wanted to see if certain bike stations were more or less associated with different genders.

What was it's result (again not graded for accuracy)?

Removing the data point by the airport (since only 1 rider went there), I got a p-value of 1.64022e-8, which implies there is a heavy association between gender and bike station usage.
